While not a note-perfect port, I think it's a pretty nice translation of the concepts and functionality of the vim plugin to the sublime context.\r\n\r\nVim-surround compatible mappings for [Vintage](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html) are available as a separate plugin here: <https://github.com/jcartledge/vintage-sublime-surround>\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Using Git\r\n\r\nGo to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory and clone the repository using the command below:\r\n\r\n`$ git clone https://github.com/jcartledge/sublime-surround.git`\r\n\r\n### Download Manually\r\n\r\nDownload the files using the .zip download option.  \r\nUnzip the files.  \r\nCopy the folder to your Sublime Text 2 Packages directory.\r\n\r\n### Package Control\r\n\r\nThis plugin is not yet available in the Package Control repository but I have submitted a pull request to have it added there and will update these instructions if/when that happens.\r\n\r\nIf you really can't wait, [here are instructions](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/usage) (under **Add Repository**) for using Package Control to install plugins which are not in the official repository.\r\n\r\n## Basic use\r\n\r\nAll functionality is accessed through the SublimeText command palette: `CTRL-SHIFT-P` on Linux and Windows, `CMD-SHIFT-P` on Mac.\r\n\r\nThere are three commands:\r\n\r\n * **Surround: surround selection**\r\n * **Surround: change surround**\r\n * **Surround: delete surround**\r\n\r\n**Surround selection** works on the current selection or selections. It prompts for the text to surround the selection with.\r\n\r\n**Change surround** works on the current cursor or cursors. It prompts for wrapper text to replace, then for the text to replace it with.\r\n\r\n**Delete surround** works on the current cursor or cursors. It prompts for wrapper text to delete. It is a special case of **Change surround** where the replacement is the empty string.\r\n\r\nSee below for more information about how search and surround text is handled.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### Pair-aware\r\n\r\nSurround understands the following pairs:\r\n\r\n * `{}`\r\n * `[]`\r\n * `()`\r\n * `<>`\r\n\r\nAs in vim-surround, specifying the opening symbol in a pair as surround text will add inner whitespace around the wrapped text. If you don't want whitespace use the closing symbol.\r\n\r\nOpening and closing items are interchangeable when specified as the text to replace or delete.\r\n\r\n#### Examples:\r\n\r\n**Changing `James Cartledge jcartledge@gmail.com`  \r\nto `James Cartledge <jcartledge@gmail.com>`**\r\n\r\n* Select the email address\r\n* Invoke the Command Palette (`CTRL-SHIFT-P`/`CMD-SHIFT-P`)\r\n* Select **Surround: surround selection**\r\n* Type `>` and press enter\r\n\r\nNote we use the closing symbol so no internal whitespace is added.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Changing `if (a > 100) doSomething();`  \r\nto `if (a > 100) { doSomething(); }`**\r\n\r\n* Select the text `doSomething();`\r\n* Invoke the Command Palette (`CTRL-SHIFT-P`/`CMD-SHIFT-P`)\r\n* Select **Surround: surround selection**\r\n* Type `{` and press enter\r\n\r\nNote here that use of the opening symbol results in addition of internal whitespace.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Changing `if (a > 100) { doSomething(); }`  \r\nto `if (a > 100) doSomething();`**\r\n\r\n* Place the cursor within the text `doSomething();`\r\n* Invoke the Command Palette (`CTRL-SHIFT-P`/`CMD-SHIFT-P`)\r\n* Select **Surround: delete surround**\r\n* Type `{` or `}` and press enter\r\n\r\nNote that when used as a search pattern rather than a replacement pattern the opening and closing symbols are interchangeable.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Tag-aware\r\n\r\nHTML/XML tags with attributes are supported, but slightly differently to vim-surround.\r\n\r\n#### Examples\r\n\r\n**Changing `Email me for more information`  \r\nto `<a href=\"mailto:jcartledge@gmail.com\">Email me</a> for more information`**\r\n\r\n* Select the text `Email me`\r\n* Invoke the Command Palette (`CTRL-SHIFT-P`/`CMD-SHIFT-P`)\r\n* Select **Surround: surround selection**\r\n* Type the opening tag including attributes: `<a href=\"mailto:jcartledge@gmail.com\">` and press enter\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Changing `<div class=\"my-custom-header\">lorem ipsum</div>`  \r\nto `<header>lorem ipsum</header>`**\r\n\r\n* Place the cursor within the text `lorem ipsum`\r\n* Invoke the Command Palette (`CTRL-SHIFT-P`/`CMD-SHIFT-P`)\r\n* Select **Surround: change surround**\r\n* Type the opening tag to replace: `<div>` and press enter\r\n* Type the replacement tag: `<header>`\r\n\r\nNote it's not necessary to specify attributes for the tag you're trying to match - by not specifying attributes you're telling the command to match that tag with no or any attributes. If you specify attributes only a tag with the exact attributes you specify will be matched.\r\n\r\nWe don't specify any attributes for the replacement `header` tag here, but if we wanted to that would work fine just as in the mailto example above.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Regular expressions\r\n\r\nAny search text in change/delete which is not a recognised pair or tag and is longer than a single character is treated as a regular expression.\r\n\r\n### Multiple cursors/selections\r\n\r\nSurround *should* support multiple cursors and selections fine, but this hasn't been tested very thoroughly as I don't really use them.\r\n\r\n## Mappings\r\n\r\nThere are no default key mappings; functionality is accessed through the SublimeText command palette.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing to stop you from creating mappings in your `User/Default.sublime-keymap` file. The commands you can map are:\r\n\r\n * `surround_selection`\r\n * `change_surround`\r\n * `delete_surround`\r\n\r\nVim-surround compatible mappings for [Vintage](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html) are available as a separate plugin here: <https://github.com/jcartledge/vintage-sublime-surround>\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nGo nuts. Clean, linted pull requests please :)\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nI have never written Python before in my life (apart from a one-line patch to another SublimeText plugin.) It's a great testament to the design of Python and the SublimeText 2 plugin API that I got this far. You have been warned.\r\n\r\n## Prior art\r\n\r\nThere is (was? It doesn't seem to be on GitHub anymore...) another plugin with similar functionality, but I don't think it's very actively maintained and I was never able to get it to work properly.\r\n","name":"Sublime-surround","google":"UA-35745224-1"}
